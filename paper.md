# Summary

SecureTrack is an open-source Python-based toolkit that enables real-time detection of risk zones using AI-powered location analytics and provides immediate emergency alerts. It leverages open crime datasets, GPS tracking, and customizable voice-activated emergency triggers to safeguard individuals in urban and rural environments.

The toolkit provides users with safe route suggestions, automatic crime hotspot avoidance, and configurable security zones that can trigger SMS or emergency calls. Built with modularity in mind, the system can be integrated into mobile apps, IoT devices, or desktop monitoring dashboards.

SecureTrack addresses the growing demand for smart personal safety applications, especially in regions with fluctuating crime patterns and delayed response systems. Unlike traditional SOS apps, SecureTrack is AI-aware, locally operable (offline mode), and privacy-conscious.

# Statement of Need

Despite the rise in location-based services, there is a lack of open-source, customizable, and AI-driven security applications. Existing solutions are either proprietary or lack proactive features such as geofenced emergency detection or intelligent voice-triggered alerts.

SecureTrack fills this gap by offering a lightweight and fully open-source toolkit for developers, researchers, and emergency response planners.

# Installation

```bash
pip install securetrack-ai
```

# Usage

```python
from securetrack import Monitor

monitor = Monitor()
monitor.load_city_crime_data('data/city_crime_map.geojson')
monitor.set_safe_zone(radius_km=1.5)
monitor.enable_voice_trigger('Help!')
monitor.start()
```
